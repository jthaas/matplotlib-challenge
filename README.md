Module 5 Matplotlib HW

This Module was very challenging for me so I used multiple resources to help solve the problems as directed, below is a list of resources from which I either used code or adapted code from.

I used the following website for assistance with dropping duplicated information in my dataframe : https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html#pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates

For help with enumerating and trying to find the duplicate Mice information I used the website : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumerate-in-python/

When creating a for loop to pull all of the final tumor volumes I used .iterrows() which I found at : https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_iterrows.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,(a%20Pandas%20Series%20object).

When creating the box and whisker plot I used the following website as a guide to get my data to display properly : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib/
